# OpenGL_C

Me, messing around in OpenGL C, as the name would suggest. No long term goals apart from making some funny first person shooter thing.

Setting up the environment, in case you want to join in the fun:

1. Clone this repo somewhere
2. Follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s8C9dXRXmM to set up glfw and glad. I'm using the latest version of glfw and glad 3.3.
3. Run build.py to compile the whole thing.
4. Pray everything works, open an issue if it doesn't.




Started again in https://github.com/pigslyer/Kittystein
First C project, so there were some organizational mistakes that I hope I've learned from.
